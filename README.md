# Domain & Server Management Panel  

A web application built with **Django Ninja** (backend) and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (frontend) to provide a simple yet powerful management panel for company-owned domains, servers, and hosting services.  

The goal of this project is to centralize the monitoring of all purchased domains and servers in one place, ensuring that nothing expires unnoticed and uptime is continuously monitored.
